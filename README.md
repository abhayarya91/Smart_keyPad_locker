IoT Smart Lock with Keypad and ThingSpeak Integration
This project demonstrates a smart lock system using an ESP8266, a servo motor, a keypad, and ThingSpeak for remote monitoring. The lock can be unlocked using a pre-set passcode or a master passcode, and it tracks lock and unlock status remotely via the ThingSpeak platform.

Features
Keypad Unlocking: Users can unlock the lock using a predefined passcode or master passcode.
Master Key: After 3 incorrect attempts, the lock will require the master key to unlock.
ThingSpeak Integration: Lock status updates (lock/unlock events and incorrect attempts) are sent to a ThingSpeak channel for remote monitoring.
Servo Lock Mechanism: A servo motor controls the physical locking and unlocking mechanism.
WiFi Connectivity: Uses the ESP8266 to connect to a WiFi network.
Components
ESP8266 NodeMCU: Microcontroller that connects to WiFi and controls the lock.
Servo Motor: Controls the physical locking mechanism.
4x4 Keypad: Allows user to input a passcode for unlocking the lock.
ThingSpeak Account: To monitor lock status remotely.
Setup Instructions
Hardware Requirements
ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
Servo Motor
4x4 Keypad
Breadboard and connecting wires
Power supply for ESP8266
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
ESP8266 board package installed in the Arduino IDE
ThingSpeak account with a created channel
Libraries
Make sure you have the following libraries installed in the Arduino IDE:

ESP8266WiFi.h (for WiFi connectivity)
Servo.h (for controlling the servo motor)
ThingSpeak.h (for ThingSpeak communication)
Keypad.h (for keypad input)
Wiring Diagram
ESP8266 Pin	Component
D0	Servo Motor
D1-D7	Keypad Rows/Cols
D8	LED (Optional for Lock Indicator)
Configuration
Open the secrets.h file and update the following with your WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak channel info:
cpp
Copy code
#define SECRET_SSID "your_ssid"
#define SECRET_PASS "your_password"
#define SECRET_CH_ID your_channel_id
#define SECRET_WRITE_APIKEY "your_thingspeak_write_key"
Upload the code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
Usage
Connect your ESP8266 to your WiFi network.
The keypad will allow users to enter the passcode. If the correct passcode is entered, the servo motor will unlock the system.
After 3 consecutive wrong attempts, the system will lock and require the master passcode to unlock.
The lock/unlock status and wrong attempts will be updated on ThingSpeak.
You can monitor the status of your lock remotely using ThingSpeak.
Example ThingSpeak Channel Setup
Field 1: Lock/Unlock status
Field 2: Wrong attempts
Future Enhancements
Add an alert system (e.g., sound alarm) after multiple failed attempts.
Include an OLED display to show lock status.
Expand the passcode functionality to allow multiple users.
